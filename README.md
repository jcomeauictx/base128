# base128

I woke up this morning (2024-07-28) thinking about encodings, and wondering
why base128 wasn't used instead of base64. So I googled and found
[John La Rooy's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26332635/493161) to
a question on StackOverflow: in short, it exists, and he uses it. But didn't
provide a link. So I decided to code one myself.

[2024-08-09] I've since found [another person's code](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/base128-encoding), but haven't checked if it works the same way. I
doubt it would. [And another](https://github.com/code4fukui/Base128), [and
another](https://crates.io/crates/base128)...
